# AGENTS Instructions

* Gradle commands are time-consuming because they download large dependencies. Avoid running any Gradle commands (such as `gradle` or `./gradlew`) in this repository.
* There are no mandatory programmatic checks for this repository.
* Use common prefixes across all modules within multi-module projects. The prefix for this project is `move-tab`; modules should be named using this prefix (e.g. `move-tab-plugin`).
* `AGENTS.md` should be continually updated when new or helpful standards or conventions are brought up during interactions.
